                The first place to grind Combat XP is the Deep Caverns, as the player can find lapis zombies, and miner skeletons/zombies. The next step are the crypts, located in a cave at the edge of the graveyard and are home to crypt ghouls. These give a good amount of combat xp and are often used to spwan the Revenent Horror boss. The next step a player could take are the enderman located in the End. These can be grinded for both Combat XP and Ender Armor pieces. Although it may be more expensive, the Tier 5 Revenant Horror is a good way to grind Combat XP. Once the player starts to play dungeons, Combat XP will be gained passively as every mob gives a decent amount of Combat XP, and will eventually add up over time. If the player is able to efficiently clear the Floor 6 Dungeon, a good way to gain a lot of Combat XP are the Golems in the F6 boss room. Another way to gain Combat XP is through Ghosts. Ghosts are found in "The Mist" in the Dwarven Mines. They have 1 million hp and only take melee damage.

Start out on young or unstable dragon armor, as they are relatively cheap and very useful. Young dragon will provide speed and damage, while unstable will do slightly more damage but without speed buffs. The player can then upgrade to strong or wise dragon if they choose to.

Both are very good until you can make the next upgrade and are about the same price. An important thing to note is that the aspect of the end can be kept due to its high usefulness in its teleport ability. The next weapon to carry you into mid game is the aspect of the dragons(also called aotd for short). This weapon is quite strong and can be used as a weapon for dungeons as well.

Ashfang can only be damaged in margins of 2m, by blaze souls. Blaze souls are spawned when one of his minions are killed, right where the blaze was before it died. Players must aim carefully(because easy to miss), and left click to shoot it at ashfang. Ashfang will heal 2m hp for each type of blaze not killed when he calls them back.

            Scarf has 2 phases:
            **Phase 1:** The four Tombstones on the sides of the Boss room will break open and spawn four different mobs. The Undead Warrior is supposed to resemble a berserker in that it weilds a sword and has an ability that allows it too teleport toward its enemies. The Undead Mage is a Mage and will attack you with ranged magic attacks. The Undead Archer is an Archer and will shoot you with a bow. Finally the Undead Priest is a Healer class mob that constantly heals Scarf.
            **Phase 2:** After you defeat the 4 Undeads, Scarf will begin attacking the player and all 4 Undeads will respawn. For players starting out killing all 4 then targeting Scarf will probably be the best way to defeat the boss, but if possible, targeting the Undead Priest and then Scarf without caring about the other Undeads is also a viable method.
            """
            disc2 = """
            In Master Mode, Scarf and his Undeads have more HP and deal way more damage. 2 of each Undead will spawn, meaning you have 2 Undead Warrior's too deal with instead of one. The Undead Warriors teleport ability is especially brutal as it will kill any mid-game player who isn't a tank. Unless your party can survive the barage of the 8 Undeads, it would be better to kill the Undeads rather than ignoring them.

Either way avoid dying until the Spirit Bear spawns. You see, Thorn only has 4 hitpoints, but can only be damaged by the Spirit Bow dropped from the Spirit Bears. So you and your party will have to kill the Spirit Bear 4 times and shoot Thorn 4 times.

            In this phase, there are two crystals on top of platforms, two players must grab those crystals and bring them to the pressure plates on the sides of the room. 

            If you are a mage, you can use a Jerry-Chine gun to boost yourself up to the crystal. (This is not recommended for other classes due to the massive mana cost of Jerry-Chine). Other classes can use the lava against the wall, and use a bonzo staff to launch themselves to the platform. Additionally, if you own spring boots, you can use those.

            After both crystals have been placed, one player (if there is a tank in the party, this is their job) must lure Maxor into the laser. A slime hat is very useful for this part, as Maxor deals true knockback, meaning shelmet will not work. After Maxor is in the laser, damage him until he becomes immune again. Then repeat the whole process again. If your party does very low damage, you may need to get the crystals a third time, but the process remains the same. This will complete phase 1.

            When dropping down into phase 2, DPS classes should prioritize clearing out Wither Skeletons at of near the Green and Yellow Pillars.

            When you see the red countdown on your screen, all party members need to stand underneath one of the pillars or else Storm will one tap you(You can also use bonzo mask or wither cloak to block this). After Storm attacks, 2 players should go stand next to the green and yellow pads. The tank will then attract Storm and lure him underneath the green pillar(Slime hat is again useful here to make it easier to avoid the knockback). The player next to the green pad will then stand on the pad to crush Storm. You can then attack Storm for a short period, before he becomes invincible. Repeat the process once more to kill Storm. If Storm doesn't die in 2 pillars, there is the third blue pillar on the other side which is garunteed to kill him.

            After Storm is killed, go stand underneath the red pillar where the floor will break and you will drop down into phase 3.

            This phase is the one that a lot of new players find the most stressful. There are four separate sections of Terminals, or mini puzzles. Each section contains 4-5 Terminals, 1 Device, and 2 levers. While most players have mods with solvers, the puzzles are simple enough to do without them. Simply read the instructions at the top of the GUI, and complete what it tells you to do. 

            For the devices, each section has a different puzzle.
            Section 1 - Simon Says (Simple enough, I don't think I need to explain this one). 
            One person should type in chat that they'll do the Simon says device, and they should ignore all other terminals and go straight to the Simon says device, as it takes a long time to complete.
            Section 2 - Lights
            A large square of glowstone lamps with levers on them is located very high up in section 2, where you have to turn all the lamps on. The fastest way to do this is hit the 4 levers in the corners, and then the 2 in the middle.

            Section 3 - Arrow Maze
            A bunch of arrows are in item frames on a wall. Rotate them until the block behind the item frame changes into a sea lantern. Repeat for all arrows.
            Section 4 - Targets
            A player must stand on the pressure plate somewhat up high, and shoot all of the green targets. Note, multiple players can shoot at the targets at the same time.

            After all four sections of terminals are complete, a gold door will drop down, where everyone must run inside. Goldor will then slowly approach, and if you get too close to him, you'll die. This section is all about DPS, however, note that Wither Impact does not damage Goldor. This phase relies heavily on the archer, as they will be dealing the most ranged damage. It is also helpful to have someone (usually the tank) hit Goldor with a last breath to lower his defence.

If there is a tank in the party, they should take Necron's aggro and then go into one of the corners in the iron pillars, so that the other party members can hit Necron without him moving too much.

            After enough damage is done to Necron, you will be blinded, and he will move to the centre platform. Here, you just damage him. After a certain amount of time, he will fly back towards the party, where you can just repeat the same thing described before. Necron can usually be killed in 2 phases, however, weaker parties may take longer.

To start the bossfight, each player has to pick up a Relic from the mouth of the 5 Dragon Alters and place them at the feet of the castle looking structure. This will summon the Wither King and 5 Withered Dragons. This bossfight is a bit confusing, but all the party needs too do is kill the 5 dragons while they are close too their respective alters(The closeness is indicated by particles). Killing a dragon in the wrong place will cause it to respawn. The Wither King also likes to attack the party with AoE attacks so look out for those. Defeating the 5 Dragons in a timely manner will end the fight. Failing to kill all 5 dragons in a certain amount of time will cause your party too be crushed by a giant hand.
